title: Text analysis of Trump's tweets 
---

In my first assignment for the Communication and Argumentation course, I read [the article by David Robison](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) analyzing tweets from Donald Trump's account, in order to identify if they were written by himself or not. It was very interesting to see applications of text mining and sentiment analysis. I'm excited about the possibility of doing analysis like this in the near future.
